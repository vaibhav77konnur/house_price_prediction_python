Developed a machine learning model to predict house prices
based on various features such as size, number of bedrooms, and location. Utilized a dataset of 10,000 housing records
and performed data preprocessing including handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical
variables. Implemented a linear regression algorithm to train the model and evaluated its performance with an
R-squared score of 0.85 and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 200,000. This project demonstrates skills in data
preprocessing, regression analysis, and evaluation of model performance
